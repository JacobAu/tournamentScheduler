Have you ever wanted to defeat your friends in a friendly game of 1v1 mario kart, but didn't know the algorithm to make a round robin? 
With my c++ program, you can now do just that! 

Future Goals: 
1. Single Elimination Bracket
2. Double Elimination Bracket 
3. GUI (so you dont have to do it through the console :/ ) 


## notes 
Really the purpose of this was to refresh my knowedge of C++ syntax and memory management of the heap. Pointers, passing by reference, and general algorithm implementation were my goals.
