Have you ever wanted to defeat your friends in a friendly game of 1v1 mario kart, but didn't know the algorithm to make a round robin? 
With my c++ program, you can now do just that! 

Future Goals: 
1. Single Elimination Bracket
2. Double Elimination Bracket 
3. GUI (so you dont have to do it through the console :/ )
